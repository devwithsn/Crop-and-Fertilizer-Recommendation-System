Week-2
This week, I focused on data visualization to analyze soil properties, weather patterns, and crop suitability. I created line graphs for temperature and rainfall trends, and a correlation heatmap to identify key relationships between soil factors and crop yield. Using Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, these insights will enhance the accuracy of our recommendation system.
